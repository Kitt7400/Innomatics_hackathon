# Innomatics Hackathon Task 🚀

This repository contains my solution for the **Innomatics Hackathon Task**, where I applied data analysis and machine learning concepts to solve a real-world problem using Python.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with data, perform exploratory analysis, preprocess features, and derive meaningful insights.
